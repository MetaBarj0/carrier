# This is the manifest file of the appliance. It gathers all informations that
# are necessary to build the appliance from scratch as soon as your system is
# correctly bootstrapped.
# It must respect the 'sh' syntax as it defines variables that are sourced at
# runtime to build the appliance.
# Mandatory variables are :
# - BASE: specify the base image to use in order to build appliance. Note that
#   busybox is perfectly sufficient. Moreover, you _SHOULD_ note use any image
#   having a libc different than musl if you use metabarj0/* images as part of
#   your appliance
# - IMAGES: declare all images that are necessary to build the appliance. If one
#   image is not present on your docker host but defined in the share/images
#   directory, the system will attempt to build it first.
# - EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS: set of Dockerfile command that will be appended
#   to the end of the generated appliance's Dockerfile. Though you could specify
#   any command here as no checks are made, you will find this feature useful if
#   you need to specify environment stuff (ENV command) or a specific entrypoint
#   (ENTRYPOINT command)
# - SERVICE: the name of the service that exists in the docker-compose.yml file
#   that the user can run to work with the appliance.
# - ENVIRONMENT: A variable containing a list of instructions that set variables
#   to be used as environment when running the appliance's service exposed to
#   the user

# this is the base image used to create the appliance docker image
BASE=busybox

# These are image required to build the appliance. If these image are not built
# on your docker host but defined in the share/images/ directory, the system
# will first attempt to build them.
