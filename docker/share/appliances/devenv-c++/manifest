# This is the manifest file of the appliance. It gathers all informations that
# are necessary to build the appliance from scratch as soon as your system is
# correctly bootstrapped.
# It must respect the 'sh' syntax as it defines variables that are sourced at
# runtime to build the appliance.
# Mandatory variables are :
# - IMAGES: declare all images that are necessary to build the appliance. If one
#   image is not present on your docker host but defined in the share/images
#   directory, the system will attempt to build it first.

# These are image required to build the appliance. If these image are not built
# on your docker host but defined in the share/images/ directory, the system
# will first attempt to build them.
