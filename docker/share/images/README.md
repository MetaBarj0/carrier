WHAT?
=====

This is the directory when all docker image projects are located.
Each directory contains all stuff that is necessary to build a docker image
that can be run.

HOW?
====

Please, take a look at the README.md file in the `docker/` directory to learn
how to build an image.

To create an image, feel free to :
* grab files in the `docker/share/template/image/` directory as skeleton
* get inspired by existing image to create yours
