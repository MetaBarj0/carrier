# This is the manifest of the project. This file MUST expose few variables for
# project being built successfully. There are 4 variables: BASE_IMAGE, REQUIRES,
# PROVIDES and EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS. See below on how to use them.

# the base image is a docker image to use as base for the image being built.
# Note that it is strongly discouraged to use a base image embedding its own
# libc (whichever its flavor) because the 'carrier' system creates images built
# with musl-libc, created by carrier itself. That said, any carrier image can be
# used as base image
BASE_IMAGE=busybox

# these are dependencies required by this project; manifest, gcc, make and
# docker-cli are built by the bootstrap project and are implicitely required
REQUIRES="metabarj0/m4"

# this section contains the docker image built by this project. only one image
# can be built per project
PROVIDES=metabarj0/gmp

# this section contains extra dockerfile commands to add at last just before the
# final image is being built. Consider to add ENV, VOLUME, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE,
# LABEL or CMD commands here if necessary. This is a multi-lines variable.
FINAL_EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS=""
