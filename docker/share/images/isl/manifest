# This is the manifest of the project. This file MUST expose few variables for
# project being built successfully. There are 4 variables: BASE_IMAGE, REQUIRES,
# PROVIDES and EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS. See below on how to use them.

# the base image is a docker image to use as base for the image being built.
# Note that it is strongly discouraged to use a base image embedding its own
# libc (whichever its flavor) because the 'carrier' system creates images built
# with musl-libc, created by carrier itself. That said, any carrier image can be
# used as base image
BASE_IMAGE=busybox

# REQUIRES contains the dependencies required by this project; manifest, gcc,
# make and docker-cli are built by the bootstrap project and are implicitely
# required for any project. This is a multi-lines variable that could be set as:
# REQUIRES="dependency1
# dependency2
# dependency3
# dependency4
# ...
# " as an example. Note that each value must be a conform docker image name.
REQUIRES="metabarj0/gmp
metabarj0/wget"

# this section contains the docker image built by this project. only one image
# can be built per project. Once this project is built, the value of this
# variable can be used in REQUIRES variable of other project to specify that
# this image is a dependency. This is a single value variable that could be set
# as:
# PROVIDES=new_image
# Note that the value must be a conform docker image name
PROVIDES=metabarj0/isl

# this section contains extra dockerfile commands to add at last just before the
# final image is being built. Consider to add ENV, VOLUME, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE,
# LABEL or CMD commands here if necessary. This is a multi-lines variable.
FINAL_EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS=""
