# REQUIRES contains the dependencies required by this project; manifest, gcc,
# make and docker-cli are built by the bootstrap project and are implicitely
# required for any project. This is a multi-lines variable that could be set as:
# REQUIRES="dependency1
# dependency2
# dependency3
# dependency4
# ..." as an example. Note that each value must be a conform docker image name.
REQUIRES=""

# this section contains the docker image built by this project. only one image
# can be built per project. Once this project is built, the value of this
# variable can be used in REQUIRES variable of other project to specify that
# this image is a dependency. This is a single value variable that could be set
# as:
# PROVIDES=newimage
# Note that the value must be a conform docker image name
PROVIDES=metabarj0/m4

# this is the docker image to use as fetcher. The fetch command will be executed
# within this image. If you don't need to fetch anything, you can leave this
# variable empty or undefined.

# This is the command to use to fetch sources. If your image does not require
# any tarball, leave this variable empty or do not define it

# require any tarball, leave this variable empty or do not define it.

# this variable groups extra dockerfile commands you can incorporate to the
# generated Dockerfile used to build the image.
# Commands that are specified here won't be incorporated in the Dockerfile used
# to build the final image. For that purpose, FINAL_EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS is
# the beast you're looking for.
# This is a multi-line variable

# the base image is a docker image to use as base for the image being built.
# Note that it is strongly discouraged to use a base image embedding its own
# libc (whichever its flavor) because the 'carrier' system creates images built
# with musl-libc, created by carrier itself. That said, any carrier image can be
# used as base image
BASE_IMAGE=busybox

# this section contains extra dockerfile commands to add at last just before the
# final image is being built. Consider to add ENV, VOLUME, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE,
# LABEL or CMD commands here if necessary. This is a multi-lines variable.
