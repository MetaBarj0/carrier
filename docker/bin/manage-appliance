The appliance's manifest file is ill formed as it lacks one or several mandatory
variable values.
In order to build an appliance, you must provide a value for the following
mandatory variables :

  IMAGE_NAME      : the built appliance docker image name
  CONTAINER_NAME  : the container name of the running appliance
  REQUIRED_IMAGES : necessary docker images used to build the appliance
  SERVICE         : name of the service to interact with the appliance

You can also set these optional variables :

  EXTENDS                   : Specify that this appliance will extend aplliances
                              specified in this variable value (NYI)
  BASE_IMAGE                : the docker base image to use to create this
                              appliance. Not that you specifying an image having
                              its own libc (no matter its flavor is strongly
                              discouraged and could break your appliance)
  EXTRA_DOCKERFILE_COMMANDS : A set of Dockerfile command to append to the
                              generated Dockerfile used to build your appliance.
                              Usually, ENTRYPOINT command goes here but you're
                              not limited to this specific command. For instance,
                              you can use this variable to create supplementary
                              building stage using the last generated building
                              stage aliased with your appliance image name
  ENVIRONMENT               : a set of key=value pairs that is passed to the
                              command that run a built appliance.
